An investment project is a detailed plan for committing capital today to generate future economic benefits. It's a fundamental driver of business expansion and economic growth, aimed at goals like acquiring new equipment, real estate development, or launching innovative products.
​A successful project requires clearly defined goals, detailed financial projections (including expected returns), and thorough risk assessment. Key financial metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are used to evaluate its viability. The ultimate objective is to maximize returns, minimize risks, and ensure the project aligns with the overall strategic objectives of the investors or the organization.
